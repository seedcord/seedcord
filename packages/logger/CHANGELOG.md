# @seedcord/logger

## 0.3.2

### 🩹 Patch

#### 📦 Seedcord packages

- `@seedcord/types` 0.12.0 → 0.13.0
- `@seedcord/errors` 0.7.0 → 0.8.0
- `@seedcord/utils` 0.8.10 → 0.8.11

## 0.3.1

### 🩹 Patch

#### 📦 Seedcord packages

- `@seedcord/errors` 0.6.0 → 0.7.0
- `@seedcord/types` 0.11.0 → 0.12.0
- `@seedcord/utils` 0.8.9 → 0.8.10

## 0.3.0

### 💥 Breaking

- Every shared symbol key now reads `seedcord:` plus kebab-case. Plugin service metadata moved to the same global registry the core keys use. Make sure to update your packages together! You don't need to change any code for this. ([#301](https://github.com/seedcord/seedcord/pull/301))

### 🩹 Patch

#### 📦 Seedcord packages

- `@seedcord/errors` 0.5.1 → 0.6.0
- `@seedcord/types` 0.10.1 → 0.11.0
- `@seedcord/utils` 0.8.8 → 0.8.9

## 0.2.2

### 🩹 Patch

- A log sink whose `onLog` returns a rejected promise used to crash the process. It now prints the same one-time console warning a synchronous throw does. ([#293](https://github.com/seedcord/seedcord/pull/293))
- Fix a sink that threw was still receiving records. The error line already said it won't. Now it does what the line said all this time. ([#296](https://github.com/seedcord/seedcord/pull/296))

#### 📦 Seedcord packages

- `@seedcord/errors` 0.4.3 → 0.5.0
- `@seedcord/types` 0.9.1 → 0.10.0
- `@seedcord/utils` 0.8.7 → 0.8.8

## 0.2.1

### 🩹 Patch

- Updated TSDoc reference generation. ([`1d2f1e3`](https://github.com/seedcord/seedcord/commit/1d2f1e3))

#### 📦 Seedcord packages

- `@seedcord/errors` 0.4.0 → 0.4.1
- `@seedcord/utils` 0.8.5 → 0.8.6
- `@seedcord/types` 0.9.0 → 0.9.1

## 0.2.0

### 💥 Breaking

- `paint` now comes from `@seedcord/errors`, and `ILogSink`, `LogLevel`, `LogRecord`, `LogSinkHandle`, `LoggerConfig`, `LoggerChannelId`, and `FrameworkChannel` now come from `@seedcord/types`. `@seedcord/logger` no longer re-exports them. Both transports still expose every one of these. ([`e11cbb3`](https://github.com/seedcord/seedcord/commit/e11cbb3))

### 🩹 Patch

- Update log colors in some places. ([`97b62ef`](https://github.com/seedcord/seedcord/commit/97b62ef))
- These packages now ship ESM only. `eslint-plugin-discordjs` keeps its CommonJS build. ([`f39cde0`](https://github.com/seedcord/seedcord/commit/f39cde0))
- Use `#` instead of `@` for tsconfig path aliases. ([`a259cdc`](https://github.com/seedcord/seedcord/commit/a259cdc))
- Rewrote package descriptions for all packages. Also added keywords. ([`a8d7b5f`](https://github.com/seedcord/seedcord/commit/a8d7b5f))
- Every package now declares Apache-2.0 along with its homepage, issue tracker, author, and funding link. ([`660a94d`](https://github.com/seedcord/seedcord/commit/660a94d))
- Every package now has a README describing that package, with badges and an install line. Seven of them previously shipped a copy of the root README that named no package at all. ([`c50ad6c`](https://github.com/seedcord/seedcord/commit/c50ad6c))
- Render aggregate errors ([#249](https://github.com/seedcord/seedcord/pull/249))

#### 📦 Seedcord packages

- `@seedcord/errors` 0.3.4 → 0.4.0
- `@seedcord/types` 0.8.2 → 0.9.0
- `@seedcord/utils` 0.8.4 → 0.8.5

## 0.1.4

### 💥 Breaking

- envapt is a peer dependency now. Your project and seedcord load one copy, so the framework reads the config you set through `Envapter`. ([`71a0b99`](https://github.com/seedcord/seedcord/commit/71a0b99))

### 🩹 Patch

#### 📦 Seedcord packages

- `@seedcord/errors` 0.3.3 → 0.3.4
- `@seedcord/types` 0.8.1 → 0.8.2
- `@seedcord/utils` 0.8.3 → 0.8.4

## 0.1.3

### 🩹 Patch

- Moved `paint` to the errors package ([#238](https://github.com/seedcord/seedcord/pull/238))

#### 📦 Seedcord packages

- `@seedcord/errors` 0.3.2 → 0.3.3
- `@seedcord/utils` 0.8.2 → 0.8.3

## 0.1.2

### 🩹 Patch

- Update comments ([`272b729`](https://github.com/seedcord/seedcord/commit/272b729))

#### 📦 Seedcord packages

- `@seedcord/types` 0.8.1 → 0.8.2
- `@seedcord/utils` 0.8.1 → 0.8.2

## 0.1.1

### 🩹 Patch

- Bump deps. ([#228](https://github.com/seedcord/seedcord/pull/228))
- Set all packages' node floor to LTS. ([#228](https://github.com/seedcord/seedcord/pull/228))
- The logger now catches a sink that throws. Your logging call returns normally, the other sinks still get the record, and the broken sink is reported once on the console. ([#234](https://github.com/seedcord/seedcord/pull/234))

#### 📦 Seedcord packages

- `@seedcord/types` 0.8.0 → 0.8.1
- `@seedcord/utils` 0.8.0 → 0.8.1

## 0.1.0

### 💥 Breaking

- Node 24.3 or newer is required. ([`789f17a`](https://github.com/seedcord/seedcord/commit/789f17a))

### ✨ Minor

- New `@seedcord/logger`. `Logger` assembles a record and routes it through a level gate and two sink layers. ([`789f17a`](https://github.com/seedcord/seedcord/commit/789f17a))

    The core has no `node:*` imports and runs in edge workers. The winston console and file sinks come from `@seedcord/logger/node` and is set up automatically during dev.

### 🩹 Patch

- Require envapt `^8.1.0`. An older pin in your own bot installs a second copy whose `Envapter` state splits from the framework's. ([#196](https://github.com/seedcord/seedcord/pull/196))

#### 📦 Seedcord packages

- `@seedcord/types` 0.7.2-next.0 → 0.8.0
- `@seedcord/utils` 0.7.1-next.0 → 0.8.0
