# @seedcord/types

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- a34366b: **BREAKING**: rename `Effects` → pub-sub bus. `core.effects.emit` → `core.bus.publish`. `EffectsHandler` → `Subscriber`. `@RegisterEffect` → `@Subscribe`. `Effects` augmentation interface → `Subscriptions`. config key `effects` → `subscribers`. `EffectsConfig` → `SubscribersConfig`.
- 5e4bf42: Reclassify singleton runtime dependencies as peer dependencies so a consumer resolves a single shared instance.
    - `seedcord`: `discord.js` and `reflect-metadata` are now required peer dependencies.
    - `@seedcord/plugins`: `mongoose`, `pg`, and `kysely` are optional peer dependencies (install only the backend your plugin uses); `reflect-metadata` and `seedcord` are required peers.
    - `@seedcord/types`: `discord.js` is now an optional peer dependency.
    - `@seedcord/services` and `@seedcord/utils`: `type-fest` moved to `devDependencies` (its types are inlined into the published declarations).

- 7308d36: Move the non-secret startup settings from environment variables into the runtime config. `botColor`, `shutdownEnabled`, `healthCheck` (`port`/`path`/`host`), and `notifications.developerUsername` are now set through `new Seedcord({ ... })` instead of `DEFAULT_BOT_COLOR`, `SHUTDOWN_IS_ENABLED`, `HEALTH_CHECK_PORT`/`PATH`/`HOST`, and `DEVELOPER_DISCORD_USERNAME`. Secrets (bot token, exception webhook URL, Mongo URI) stay in the environment.

    The bot color is applied when a component is used rather than when it is constructed, so a configured color reaches every component regardless of construction order, and any `ColorResolvable` (hex string, number, named color, or RGB tuple) works. The default health-check port is 6967.

    **Breaking:** the framework no longer reads those four environment variables; move their values into the config object passed to `new Seedcord(...)`. The internal `hexToNumber` helper and its `UtilHexInputType` / `UtilHexInvalid` error codes are removed.

- a34366b: **BREAKING**: drop unused utility types from `@seedcord/types` (`AnyFunction`, `AnyAsyncFunction`, `PartialExcept`, `RequiredExcept`, `ReadonlyExcept`, `EnsureUndefinedForOptionalProps`, `StrictUnion`, `ReadonlyRecord`, `PartialRecord`). Migrate in-repo `TypedOmit` consumers to `Except` from `type-fest`.
- 7e6d80e: most packages were exporting more than what they should be exporting and now have smaller imports as they should

### Patch Changes

- 225977a: export "version" variable with the actual semantic version of each package
- fe77998: build pipeline migrated from `tsup` to `tsdown`. each published package now ships `dist/index.d.mts` + `dist/index.d.cts` (cjs is a one-line re-export stub) with a per-condition `exports` map. source-level public API unchanged. `@seedcord/tsup-config` renamed to `@seedcord/tsdown-config` and made private.
- fe77998: bump peer floor: typescript `^6.0.3`, node `^22.13`. shared `tsconfig/base.json` now sets `esModuleInterop: true` and `types: ["node"]` for ts6's removed implicit defaults. no public API changes.
