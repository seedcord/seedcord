**BREAKING:** `setEmoji(Emojis.X)` on gateway used to throw through the builder's strict validation. `Emojis.X` now carries `id`, `name`, and `animated`, and the `GuildEmoji` or `ApplicationEmoji` discord.js resolved moved to `Emojis.X.source`, still typed by the codegen tag. `ResolvedEmoji` moved from `@seedcord/http` to `@seedcord/core`.
