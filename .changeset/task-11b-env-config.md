Move the non-secret startup settings from environment variables into the runtime config. `botColor`, `shutdownEnabled`, `healthCheck` (`port`/`path`/`host`), and `notifications.developerUsername` are now set through `new Seedcord({ ... })` instead of `DEFAULT_BOT_COLOR`, `SHUTDOWN_IS_ENABLED`, `HEALTH_CHECK_PORT`/`PATH`/`HOST`, and `DEVELOPER_DISCORD_USERNAME`. Secrets (bot token, exception webhook URL, Mongo URI) stay in the environment.

The bot color is applied when a component is used rather than when it is constructed, so a configured color reaches every component regardless of construction order, and any `ColorResolvable` (hex string, number, named color, or RGB tuple) works. The default health-check port is 6967.

**Breaking:** the framework no longer reads those four environment variables; move their values into the config object passed to `new Seedcord(...)`. The internal `hexToNumber` helper and its `UtilHexInputType` / `UtilHexInvalid` error codes are removed.
