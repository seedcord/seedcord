- Move the HMR types (`HmrEventType`, `HmrUpdateEvent`, `HmrAware`, and the framework/CLI event maps) from `@seedcord/cli` to `@seedcord/types/internal`. `seedcord` and `@seedcord/plugins` imported them only as types but listed `@seedcord/cli` in their runtime `dependencies`, which pulled the CLI and its Ink, React, Vite, and tsx tree into every install. Both now read the types from `@seedcord/types` and drop `@seedcord/cli` from their dependencies, so installing `seedcord` no longer installs the CLI.
- **BREAKING** (`@seedcord/cli`): the HMR types are no longer re-exported from `@seedcord/cli` and the `@seedcord/cli/vite-hmr` subpath is removed. Import these types from `@seedcord/types` instead. The Vite `CustomEventMap` augmentation stays internal to the framework and the CLI.
