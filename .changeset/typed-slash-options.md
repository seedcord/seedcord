- Add end-to-end typed slash commands. Author commands as plain discord.js builders, run `seedcord codegen` to read each command's `toJSON()` and emit a committed `declare module 'seedcord'` registry, then handlers extend the new `SlashHandler<'route'>` base and read `this.options`. Options are typed off the registry, a required option drops the null, choices narrow to their literal union, and only the getters for kinds a command actually uses appear. A handler bound to several commands branches with `this.match`, each arm typed for its own route.
- `seedcord codegen --check` regenerates in memory and exits non-zero, naming the fix, when the committed registry is stale.
- `@SlashRoute` is cross-checked against the handler generic, so `@SlashRoute('ban', 'kick')` on `SlashHandler<'ban' | 'kick'>` compiles while listing fewer or more routes than the handler declares is a compile error. Route strings are autocompleted off the generated registry.
- **BREAKING**: slash handlers now extend `SlashHandler<'route'>` instead of `InteractionHandler<ChatInputCommandInteraction>`, and `@SlashRoute` requires a `SlashHandler`. Read options through `this.options` rather than the raw `this.event.options`.
