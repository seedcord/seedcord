# Code Commenting Guidelines

Use comments to explain intent, constraints, and hidden rules. Do not use comments to narrate obvious syntax.

> **Related:** this skill decides _whether_ and _where_ a comment belongs. For _how_ a comment should read once you write it (voice, word choice, no hype or anthropomorphism), see the `writing-voice` skill.

## When Comments Are Required

Add a short comment when one of these is true:

- A rule exists because of an architectural constraint (auth boundary, caching strategy, ordering requirement, external API contract).
- A code path intentionally bypasses the more common path.
- A condition protects an invariant that would otherwise look arbitrary.
- A calculation uses authored offsets, tolerances, or thresholds in a non-obvious way.
- A validation or guardrail exists to prevent a subtle regression.

## When Comments Are Noise

Do not add comments for:

- Straightforward assignments or returns.
- Obvious control flow.
- Repeating a method or variable name in sentence form.
- General TypeScript or Node.js basics the code already expresses clearly.
- A test stub or fixture whose shape the literal already shows.

Bad:

```ts
// Set the user's display name.
user.displayName = payload.name;
```

Good:

```ts
// Display name is set from the OAuth payload at login time; later edits go through updateProfile().
user.displayName = payload.name;
```

## Preferred Comment Style

- Keep comments short and local.
- Prefer `//` inline comments over TSDoc for implementation details.
- **A TSDoc block needs a caller who would read the signature and still guess wrong.** `export` is not that test. A symbol reachable only through a package's `./internal` entry has no such caller, so it takes a `//` line or nothing. See the internal-code failure pattern below.
- **Public TSDoc uses capitals and complete sentences.** Inline `//` comments stay lowercase fragments. Both follow the writing-voice punctuation ban (no em-dash, no colon or semicolon splicing two clauses, a colon before a list or code block is fine).
- Put the comment immediately above the line or block whose intent is non-obvious.
- Explain why the rule exists or what breaks if it changes.

## Put the why on the line it explains

When a comment explains one specific line, put it on that line (`code; // why`) or right above it. Avoid a multi-sentence block at the top of the function. When one header covers three different lines, the reader has to hold all three explanations at once and map each back to the line it describes. An inline note sits where the confusion is, so the reader gets the why exactly where they need it.

Break a multi-clause header into per-line comments. Each clause moves to the line it explains, and any clause that only restates its line falls away in the move.

Why it matters:

- **Locality.** The reader meets the why at the line, not after decoding a preamble.
- **It survives edits.** An inline note is anchored to its line and gets deleted with it. A top-of-function block drifts stale as the lines beneath it change, because no one sentence is tied to any one line.
- **It forces brevity.** A line has room for one short clause, so only the load-bearing why fits. A header block invites narrate-then-justify and restatement.

Keep a block comment only for a why that genuinely spans the whole function, an invariant every line leans on or a design choice the whole body carries out, and that cannot be pinned to one line.

Bad, one header narrating three separate lines:

```ts
// the item count: addMethod appends, setMethod replaces everything before it. collectChain is
// outermost-first, so walk it reversed to follow source order. undefined when the count is not static.
function countStaticItems(calls: Call[], limit: Limit): number | undefined {
    let count = 0;
    for (const call of [...calls].reverse()) {
        const name = methodName(call);
        if (name === limit.addMethod) count += call.arguments.length;
        else if (name === limit.setMethod) count = arrayLen(call.arguments[0]);
    }
    return count;
}
```

Good, each why on the line it explains, the return-type restatement dropped:

```ts
function countStaticItems(calls: Call[], limit: Limit): number | undefined {
    let count = 0;
    // reversed to source order, so the last setX wins over earlier adds
    for (const call of [...calls].reverse()) {
        const name = methodName(call);
        if (name === limit.addMethod) count += call.arguments.length;
        else if (name === limit.setMethod) count = arrayLen(call.arguments[0]); // setX replaces
    }
    return count;
}
```

Bad, a header line for one constant:

```ts
// ButtonStyle.Link, the stable Discord wire value for a link button
const BUTTON_STYLE_LINK = 5;
```

Good, inline on the same line:

```ts
const BUTTON_STYLE_LINK = 5; // stable Discord wire value for a link button
```

## Connect Clauses The Way You'd Say Them

Once a comment earns its place, it should read like you explaining the code to someone next to you, not a telegram. Join cause and effect with the ordinary words you would use out loud, so, and, because, but, then, instead of clipping every thought into its own stiff fragment or stacking formal clauses. The punctuation ban from the `writing-voice` skill (no `—`, and no clause-splicing `;` or `:`) already pushes you here, and a connector word is almost always the replacement that reads best.

Read the comment out loud. If it sounds like something you would say to a colleague at the keyboard, keep it. If it sounds like a spec sheet, you are probably missing the connector that ties the facts together.

Stiff, clipped into fragments with no connective tissue:

```ts
// decode once. cache it. a subclass field is too late.
const cached = decodeCache.get(this);
```

Natural, the same facts joined the way you would explain them:

```ts
// decode once and cache it here, because a subclass field would initialize too late to hold
// the value (populate runs inside super()).
const cached = decodeCache.get(this);
```

## Good Patterns

Guardrails:

```ts
// Mutations must be validated server-side before write; client input is untrusted at this point.
if (!isVerifiedRequest(req)) throw new ForbiddenError();
```

Non-obvious branching:

```ts
// Retry only on 429 and 503; other 5xx errors indicate a data problem and should not be retried.
if (status === 429 || status === 503) {
    return scheduleRetry(job);
}
```

Invariants:

```ts
// Items are sorted ascending by createdAt before this point; binary search below depends on it.
const index = binarySearch(items, targetDate);
```

Thresholds and authored values:

```ts
// 50ms debounce matches the minimum polling interval guaranteed by the upstream service contract.
const DEBOUNCE_MS = 50;
```

## Anti-Patterns To Avoid

Do not turn the codebase into a wall of commentary.

Avoid:

- Commenting every branch in a method.
- Large banner comments that restate the whole function.
- JSDoc on every member just to satisfy documentation goals.
- Bug-history comments tied to one incident unless the history is essential to the rule.

Bad:

```ts
/**
 * Sets the active state.
 * @param value The value to set.
 */
setActive(value: boolean) {
    // Set active to value.
    this.active = value;
}
```

Good:

```ts
// Active flag gates all outbound event emission; callers must set this before subscribing.
setActive(value: boolean) {
    this.active = value;
}
```

## The two-pass cut, run it while you type

1. Cover the comment and read the code. Would a careful reader get it wrong? If no, delete the comment and move on.
2. Cover the code and read the comment. Every word the code already showed comes out. What survives is the why.

Run both passes on the block you just wrote, before the diff leaves your hands. A later audit catches the same thing at the cost of a full re-read of every file you touched.

## Failure Patterns To Avoid

The fastest way to slip past the checklist is to write a comment that LOOKS like a "why" but actually narrates the code first and then tacks the why on the end. Catch these:

### Narrate-then-justify

```ts
// Anti: lead-in restates the next line; only the second sentence is load-bearing.
// We anchor the write to BaseClass rather than `this`: subclass calls would otherwise
// create an own property on the subclass while readers walk up to the base and miss it.
BaseClass._strict = value;
```

```ts
// Drop the lead-in. Lead with the why.
// Anchored to BaseClass: `this._strict = value` creates an own-property on the subclass
// that callers reading via the base won't see.
BaseClass._strict = value;
```

### Type-system paraphrase

`@returns` and `@param` are where this hides. `@returns Whether the check passed` next to a declared `boolean` says what the signature already showed. Delete the tag. When every tag on a block is that, delete the block.

A tag earns its place by mapping inputs onto outcomes the signature cannot express, for example which of `undefined`, `true`, and an object each produces which return value.

If a comment explains a TYPE definition that's two lines above, the comment is redundant. Either the type is sufficient on its own, or the type needs a better name. Rewriting the type is almost always the right fix.

```ts
// Anti: re-states the type structure in prose right next to the type.
// `EnvaptOptions` is a discriminated union over `required` so the compile-time check
// rejects `required: true` paired with `fallback`. The runtime Validator catches the
// dynamic case that bypasses the types.
type EnvaptOptions = { required: false; fallback?: T } | { required: true; fallback?: Err<'...'> };

// Good: the brand-name and Err<> explanation belong on the brand type itself, once.
// Consumers don't need a paragraph re-explaining the union.
```

### Overload narration

Multiple overload signatures next to short `//` comments labeling each one ("Time-specific overload", "Required form, time-specific", "Required form, built-in/array") are noise: the signature already conveys this. If users need a map of overloads, write ONE TSDoc block on the implementation signature describing the family, not a per-overload caption.

### Stale-after-refactor

Every refactor invalidates some "why" comments. When you delete an overload, change a return type, or revert a design, **grep for the names you removed and clean up every comment that references them**. A stale comment is worse than a missing one: it actively misleads.

### TSDoc on internal code

Internal code gets no IDE-hover documentation. Two things count as internal, whatever the `@internal` tag marks, and whatever is reachable only through a package's `./internal` entry point. The tag covers the first and says nothing about the second, so read the `exports` map in `package.json` to tell. Use a single `//` line when a why exists, and zero comments when the name and body are self-explanatory. A four-line `/** ... */` block on a one-line accessor is signal that the name is too thin or the block is decoration.

Do not tag a member `@internal` when its whole class is already internal-only. The entry map states it, and no consumer reads the tag.

### "I'm doing X" wrapper

Comments that lead `// We do X here because...` always contain redundancy: the next line shows you doing X. Drop the wrapper, keep the because.

```ts
// Anti: `// Resolve key, then check missing under strict, then throw.` narrates 3 lines below.
// Good: NO comment. The three function calls below are self-evident.
```

## Fixing a bloated comment

The bar is "would mislead without it". "Would be slightly faster to read with it" fails it, because prose restating code costs more to keep honest across refactors than it saves on a read.

When told a comment is bloated, cut it down. A four-sentence block that restates the code three times usually still carries one real why. Keep that clause as a lowercase `//` line and drop the rest. A TSDoc block cut down to one clause becomes a `//` line too. Deleting the whole block throws the why away, a second defect on top of the first.
